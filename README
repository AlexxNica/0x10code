0x10code server written in Node.JS.

Uses MongoDB and Express.

Make sure you have nodejs, mongodb and npm installed on your machine.

To install node.js libraries, simply run "npm install" in the root of the git repo.

To run server, simply run "node app.js".

Note, you will probably have to change app.js near the bottom to bind to a different port.
